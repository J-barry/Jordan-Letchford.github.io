									that  heavy role in the construction, hardware implimentation and feature design utilised throughout this complex machinery. The first public installation of this machine can be seen in Noosa, QLD.</p>


									<p>During my work conducted at COREMATIC, I was part of the team, as a support engineer, that was tasked with designing, delevoping and fabricating a reverse 
										vending machine that could accept bottles for the 10 cents recycling initiative in Australia. This proved to be a very complex machine with countless hurdles 
										and extensive problem solving. The machine had a specific criteia that had to be met to accomodate for the Australian standards in safety, public use and for 
										the recyling scheme itself. I was heavily envolved in the mechanical, electrical and programming side of this project.
									</p>

									<p>I started with getting my hands on the tools and worked on the physical construction of the machine, this provided critical insight
										into the 'workings' of the machine. Following this, I design mechanical parts (includes CAD modelling and technical drawings),
										as required to solve issues as they arised. To ensure a high level of qualtity was obtained, I orchastrated the fabrication of the parts 
										to avoid delays, unnessary mistakes and the fabricators were held accountable for the work they delivered. As the machine was refined, I 
										handled the selection and implimentation of the stepper motors and weight system utlised in the machine's bottle checking system.
									</p>
										
									<p>The electrcial portain of the machine is complex due to the extensive sensors, AI and bottle sorting capabilities. A single line on the machine was able to 
										accept multiple bottle types and had to accuratly detect and sort them into isolated bins. I was involved in designing and wiring aspects of the electrical system
										utilised in the prototype machine. When progressing into the updated refined version of the machine, I was in charge of re-desinging the electrical system. This entailed
										the re-design of the electrical system, creating documentation, creating schematics and overseeing the production of the electrical panels/cabinets that are installed 
										inside the machines.
									</p>

									<p>For programming, I assisted the lead engineer with class implimentations in python to handle my sections of the machine. This entailed
										the software implimentation of the stepper motors and weight system which utlises ModBus and Serial. In addition, this project had a IOT 
										dashboard for tracking maintenance and providing live data for analsys. I designed and created this IOT dashboard from thingsboard. 
										The dashboard, draws data from SQL and the machine to showcase critical information, alarms and user details for maintenance and 
										performance evaluation.
									</p>
										
									<p>This project was an indepth undertaking by the team involved and taught me to fail fast and learn while embracing the ups and downs of a projects. 
										The continous 2 steps foward and 1 step back, allowed me to practice my ability to adapt and roll with the changes while still upholding a high 
										standard and focusing on the end goal.

									</p>
									<p>
										<!--The next stage to this project was the jamming. Jamming is placed under soft robotics and is where a soft, malleable membrane is filled with granular
										material, like coffee, and is placed over an object. This causes the grains to conform to the object and when the air inside the shell is vacuumed out, the
										grains will become dense and hold the object. The air can be returned to the membrane to release the object. Soft Robotics is an upcoming field of robotics,
										as it is capable of handling object of various shapes, sizes and robustness. A single tool that can solve multiple problems.-->
									</p>

									<p> The prototype of this machine was covered by the news and has been showcased on social media,
